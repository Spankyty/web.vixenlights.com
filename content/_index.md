Vixen is software for do-it-yourself lighting automation displays. Most popular at Christmas, computer-controlled displays are becoming increasingly popular for other holidays as well. With a PC and some hardware, anyone can have a professional-looking lighting display synchronized to music.

Vixen is geared primarily toward the DIYer. For those that prefer a packaged all-in-one solution, there are commercial solutions available such as Light-O-Rama. For those that prefer a lower-cost DIY solution, Vixen may be the software for you. There is a broad base of software plug-ins to support different hardware designs. Additionally, you can create your own plug-ins to support your hardware.

Please feel free to browse the wiki or the forum and decide if Vixen is right for you. If not, we thank you for taking the time to evaluate Vixen. If so, feel free to join the support forum. Most of what you’ll do in Vixen is a result of a user’s input. Our users are part of what makes Vixen what it is.
