Vixen is software for do-it-yourself lighting automation displays. Most popular at Christmas, computer-controlled displays are becoming increasingly popular for other holidays as well. With a PC and some hardware, anyone can have a professional-looking lighting display synchronized to music.

Vixen is geared primarily toward the DIYer. For those that prefer a packaged all-in-one solution, there are commercial solutions available such as Light-O-Rama. For those that prefer a lower-cost DIY solution, Vixen may be the software for you. There is a broad base of support for different hardware controller designs as well as export functionality to run on external players such as Falcon Pi Player. 

Please feel free to browse the wiki or the forum and decide if Vixen is right for you. If not, we thank you for taking the time to evaluate Vixen. If so, feel free to join one of the support forums.
