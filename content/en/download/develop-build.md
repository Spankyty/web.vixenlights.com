### Latest Development Build

The Vixen team makes regular development builds available so that users can help out by testing brand new features and bug fixes.  If you would like to participate and use the development builds, there’s a few things you should know.

Before using the dev builds, please take the time to create an account on our [Bug Tracker][1].  This is our bug tracking and feature request system.  If you run into any issues while using a develoment or release build, please create a ticket describing the problem.  You may want to scan thru the recent tickets to make sure it’s not already reported.  If it is, please comment on the existing ticket with any additional information you may have relating to the issue.

Development builds may not be stable especially early in the year. They are built by an automatic system and are not tested at all before being made available online. These builds are for testing the software prior to formal release.

**It is very important to make a backup copy of your entire data folder before installing a development build.**  

There is a very real risk of corrupting all of your data, or getting stuck in a loop that you cannot recover from or any other catastrophic anomaly.

While our developers test their own work, there are several independent programmers working on the application.  When their work comes together, there are times when one person’s changes conflict with another.  These development builds are where the problems are discovered.
