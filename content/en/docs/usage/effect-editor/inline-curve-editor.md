## Inline Curve Editor

![Inline Curve Editor](/images/docs/usage/effect-editor/inline-curve-editor/InlineCurve-300x49.png)

* To add a node, hold the control key and click the line where you want to add the node.
* To delete a node, hold the alt key and click the node you wish to delete.
* To move a node, simply click and drag any node.
* To flatten the curve into a horizontal line, hold the shift key and click anywhere in the curve control. Holding shift while dragging will allow you to position that horizontal flat line up and down. This function is intended to replace the functionality of the old simple sliders that have now been replaced with curves.
* To reverse the curve direction, (flip left to right) hold Control and Shift while clicking  the curve.
* To invert the curve (flip top to bottom), hold Alt and Shift while clicking the curve.
* Just like in the previous versions, drag and drop still works with these new editors. You can drag curves from the preset library and drop them onto the curve in the effect editor. The opposite also works. You can drag the curve from the effect editor pane to the preset library.
* To invoke the full curve editor, simply double click on the black area of the curve control.
* When a curve is linked to a library curve, the line will be gray and a link icon will appear over the control.

You will not be able to edit the linked curve in the effect editor pane.  Double clicking the curve control will allow you to link or unlink or edit the library curve.
