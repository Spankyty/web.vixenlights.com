The Timeline is the heart of the sequence editor. It is divided up from left to right in minutes and seconds. Top to bottom in rows are the [elements][1] you have defined in the [Display Setup][2]. These should correspond to the props in your display and may have [groups][1] of props that you have organized. Any groups can be expanded to reveal the sub elements or groups. The timeline can be zoomed in or out to show as much or little of the time the sequence covers. There are keyboard and mouse shortcuts to control the zoom and allow panning from left to right and up and down. See the [Editor Shortcuts][3] section for more details on these commands.

The ruler along the top contains the hash marks for the time intervals. These will vary from minutes to seconds to milliseconds as you zoom in and out. You can also click here to place a caret as the starting place or drag and select a range for the sequence when playing. See [Playing Sequences][4] for more information on this feature.

[Effects][5] can be added to the elements in multiple ways. You can drag the effect from the Effect list docker onto any place in the timeline. They can also be added from the context menu by right clicking in the place you wish to add it and then navigating to the effect and selecting the desired one. Effects are added with a default length of 2 seconds and default settings that are helpful to get you going. More control over how effects are added can be obtained by using the [Draw Mode][6] feature. Once an effect is on the timeline it can be edited in the Effect Editor docking widow by selecting it. See the [Effect Editor][7] section for details on editing effects.

Effects can be moved around on the timeline by simply clicking on them and dragging it to the desired location. The length can also be changed by dragging on the beginning or end of the effect. A tool tip will appear when resizing to show the start and duration of the effect. The same tool tip will appear when hovering over the effect. Multiple effects can be moved or resized at the same time by multi selecting them. This uses standard select means of Ctrl/Shift click as you would see in any modern windows app. Once you have multiples selected, they can be moved or resized as a group. See the section on [Alignment Helpers][8] and the [Draw Indicator][9] sections for further ways to manipulate effects in relation to each other.

Effects can also be copied and pasted from one place to another. Normal paradigms apply for this mechanism. Anther way to make a quick copy of an effect if to Ctrl click and then drag on the effect. This will clone the selected effect(s) and allow you to quickly drag a copy of it else where.

The timeline settings are saved with each sequence you edit. Thus when you return, the place on the timeline will be restored along with expanded groups and row sizings to get you back sequencing as quickly as possible.
