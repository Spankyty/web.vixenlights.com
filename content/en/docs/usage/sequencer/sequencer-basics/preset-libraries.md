The editor has docking windows to manage presets for [Curves][1], Colors and [Gradients][3]. Here you can create collections of your most used values. They can be dragged from these docker windows directly onto effects, or to the appropriate place in the [Effect Editor][2]. The same libraries can be enabled as a toolbar in addition or in palce of the docker window. All the same features are available from the toolbar as in the docker.
