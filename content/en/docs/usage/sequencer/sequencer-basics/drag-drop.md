### Drag & Drop Colors, Gradients, Curves ###

Color, Color Gradient, and Curves can be dragged from the library dockers directly onto effects, or onto the appropriate color/gradient/curve box in the effect editor. They can also be dragged from the editor out onto other effects. If you have your libraries in a toolbar view, they can be dragged from there similarly to how effects can be dragged from the toolbar. If you are dropping them on the timeline, it can be dropped on a group of selected effects. For example, if you have 5 Pulse effects selected, and drop a gradient on one of them, it will be applied to all of the selected ones. If an effect has more than one possible target for the color, gradient, or curve your are dropping, you will be given a pop up option to select which attribute to replace.

### Drag & Drop Files ###

You can Drag files from Windows Explorer and drop them onto a row / location on the timeline. Multiple files and file typesÂ can be dragged at the same time. This will determine the type of the files and attempt to create the proper effect that can utilize the file in the location the files were dropped.

Supported Effects are:

**Picture** all standard picture types.

**Video** all standard video types.

**Glediator** .gled file types.

**Shapes** .svg file types (Scalable Vector Graphics files).

Here is a video demonstration of the file drag and drop feature.
