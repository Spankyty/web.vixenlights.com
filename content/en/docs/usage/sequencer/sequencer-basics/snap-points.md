Snap points can be turned on with the Magnet icon in the tool bar. These allow effects to snap to other effects or to Marks you have made in the Mark Manager. Effects are stronger than Marks by default. You can increase the strength of the Marks in the Mark Manager by increasing their weight setting. You can also increase the overall strength of all the snap points by using the drop down next to the magnet and selecting a multiplier.
