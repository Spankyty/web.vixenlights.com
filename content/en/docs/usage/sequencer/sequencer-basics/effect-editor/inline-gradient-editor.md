### Overview

The Inline Curve Editor is a powerful tool that allows many features of the full [Color Gradient][1] editor dialog to be done inline in the effect editor. This improves efficency for the user since they do not have to keep opening and closing a bulky dialog box.

### Editing Colors

* To add a color node, simply click in the empty space just below the gradient image.
* To delete a node, hold the Alt Key and Click on the node you want to delete.
* To change the color of a node, Double Click on the node.
* Nodes can be dragged to change the positon of the blend.
* Fine editing of the blend or the points between colors is still done with the full editor.

### Drag Drop

  Using the gradient library, you can drag colors or gradients from the preset library or toolbar and drop them onto the gradient in the effect editor. The opposite also works to add a gradient to the library. You can also drag the gradient from the effect editor to another effect on the timeline. If the effect on the timeline has multiple gradients, you will be prompted for which gradient to replace.

### Shortcuts

Sometimes you may want the reverse of an existing gradient that is being used. You can use Alt+Shift and Click on the gradient in the effect editor and it will reverse the color order.

### Full Gradient Editor

* To invoke the full gradient editor, simply double click on the gradient in the effect editor.

### Library Gradients

* When a gradient is linked to a library gradient, a link icon will appear over the gradient control and no nodes will be shown.

You will not be able to edit the linked gradient in the effect editor pane.Â  Double clicking the gradient control will allow you to link or unlink the library gradient. Once it is unlinked, you can edit it in the inline editor or the Full Gradient Editor.
