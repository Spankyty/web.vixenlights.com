The toolbar has icons for play, pause and start. These can be used to control the playback of the sequence in the editor. In addition to these basic functions, you can have custom playback points or ranges.

The spacebar acts as a shortcut to play and stop the sequence. It works the same as clicking the play/stop buttons in the toolbar.

Clicking once in the timeline will display a single arrow head and give you a play from point. If a range is selected, this will cancel the range and create new start point. Any playback will now start from this selected point.

Ctrl and click once in the time line will auto play from that point. Original range or single play point will be restored after play finishes.

Clicking and dragging in the time line will create a range to play. Playing will then only play this range of the sequence.

Holding Control while selecting the play range will auto play on mouse release. Original range or single play point will be restored after play finishes when the range is selected using the control key.

Click on |< icon left of play button returns play start marker to beginning. If range is selected range will extend to beginning.  
Click on >| icon right of stop button pushes play range to end.

Looping is also possible. By selecting the loop button on the play bar the sequencer will play in a loop the entire sequence or the selected play range.

Delayed start is possible under Sequence -> Playback -> Play Options.
