### Overview

Creates an effect that animates concentric circles.

---

### String Setup

  * **Positioning** - Determines how the target elements are treated.  Either as individual strings or by their actual location in the display preview.
                      Locations is often referred to as whole house, but it can be any form of multiple props. 
                      Generally you want Strings when applying to one prop and locations if the target is multiple props.
  
  * **Orientation** - Controls the orientation of the display area (matrix).

---

### Configuration

* **Fill** - Selects the type of fill for the circles between _Fade_, _Empty_, _Gradient Over Time_, and _Gradient Over Element_.

* **Direction** - Configures the movement of the circles between either _In_ or _Out_.

* **Speed** - Configures the speed of the radially pattern of the circles.

* **Size** - Controls the size of the concentric circles.

* **Circles** - Controls the number of circles displayed.

### Movement

* **Horizontal Offset** - Controls the center positioning of the effect in the horizontal plane. 

* **Vertical Offset** - Controls the center positioning of the effect in the vertical plane.

---

### Color

* **Gradients** - Controls the color of the effect.

---

### Brightness

* **Intensity** - This is an overall brightness intensity curve over the duration of the effect.
                  This is a legacy parameter, consider using intensity overlay layers instead.
