## Overview

Creates a pulsing effect reminiscent of the flapping wings of a butterfly.

---

## String Setup

  * **Positioning** - Determines how the target elements are treated.  Either as individual strings or by their actual location in the display preview.
                      *Locations* is often referred to as whole house, but it can be any form of multiple props. 
                      Generally you want *Strings* when applying to one prop and *Locations* if the target is multiple props.
  
  * **Orientation** - Controls the orientation of the display area (matrix).

## Configuration

**Butterfly Type**  - Allows you to choose between different movement patterns.  Different patterns may be suitable for different element group types.
* _Pulsing Circle_ 
* _Pulsing Grid of Circles_ 
* _Alternating Inverted Boxes_ 
* _Flapping Wings_ 
    
**Direction** - Changes the direction in which the pattern moves.  This is more evident on the linear Butterfly types than it is on the pulsing or oscillating types.
* _Forward_ 
* _Backword_ 

**Motion** - Controls how the effect progresses across time.
* _Iterations_ - Displays the **Iterations** slider to specify the number of times the pattern repeats over the duration of the effect.
* _Speed_ - Displays a **Speed** Curve for configuring the speed of the pattern over the duration of the effect.

**Iterations** - The number of times the pattern repeats over the duration of the effect.

**Speed** - Controls the speed of the repeating pattern over the duration of the effect.

**Repeat** -  The number of times the pattern repeats in each iteration.

**Background Skips** - The number of time the background is skipped per pattern

**Background Chunks** -  Divides the background into a number of chunks for a &#8220;broken up&#8221; pattern.

### Color

**Color Scheme** - Controls the color scheme used for the effect.
* _Gradient_ - Uses the gradient defined below to set the colors for the effect.
* _Rainbow_ - Uses a fixed rainbow color palette for the effect.

---

### Brightness

* **Intensity** - This is an overall brightness intensity curve over the duration of the effect. 
                  This is a legacy parameter, consider using intensity overlay layers instead.
