### Overview

The pattern mode of the morph effect assists the user in drawing repeated shapes on a display element. 
In this mode the user draws one shape using the Polygon Editor.  
Then in the Morph Effect settings configures how the shape should be repeated.  
The user is able to determine in what direction to repeat the shape and how many times to repeat it.

This mode can also be used to seed the Free Form mode.  
The user can create a repeating pattern of shapes and switch the effect to Free Form mode and the shapes will be retained.  
Once in Free Form mode the user can configure settings on each of the shapes individually.

### Polygon Configuration

* **Fill Type** - Determines how the shape (polygon/ellipse/line) is filled (Wipe, Solid, or Outline).

  * _Wipe_ - This fill type performs a wipe effect across the shape for the duration of the effect.  The wipe is colored with head and tail color gradient.
  * _Solid_ - This fill type fills the shape using the Polygon Color gradient.  This fill type is useful for when using the shape as a layering mask.
  * _Outline_ - This fill type outlines the shape using the Polygon Color gradient.

* **Edit Polygons** - Select this button to display the polygon editor to draw polygons, ellipses and lines on the display element.


### Pattern Configuration

* **Repeat Count** &#8211; Determines  how many times to repeat the shape (polygon/ellipse/line).

* **Repeat Direction** &#8211; Determines the direction of the repeating pattern of shapes (polygons/ellipses/lines).

* **Repeat Skip** &#8211; Determines the spacing in-between the repeating shapes (polygons/ellipses/lines).

* **Stagger** &#8211; Determines if the start time of the wipe is staggered for the repeating polygons/ellipses/lines.

### Wipe Configuration

* **Head Length** &#8211; Determines the length of the head wipe in pixels.

* **Head Duration** &#8211; Determines the percentage of the effect duration it takes the wipe head to travel across the shape (polygon/ellipse.line).

* **Head Color** – Determines the wipe head color over the duration of the effect.

* **Head Intensity** &#8211; Controls the brightness of the head wipe over the duration of the effect.

* **Tail Color** – Determines the wipe tail color over the duration of the effect.

* **Tail Intensity** &#8211; Controls the brightness of the tail wipe over the duration of the effect.

* **Acceleration** &#8211; Determines the acceleration of the shape&#8217;s (polygon/ellipse/line) wipe.  The acceleration can be either increasing or decreasing (deceleration).
