## String Setup
 
  * **Orientation** - Controls the orientation of the display area (matrix).
---

## Movement

* **Movement Type** - Select between _Iterations_ or _Speed_.  When set to iterations, the **Iterations** slider will adjust the number of times the pattern will repeat over the duration of the effect.
When Movement Type is set to Speed, the **Speed** slider will control the speed of each iteration.

* **Iterations** - Controls how many times the pattern repeats over the timespan.

* **Speed** - Controls the speed of the pattern.

---

## Configuration

* **File Name** - Selects the Glediator file you wish to use.

---

## Brightness

* **Intensity** - This is an overall brightness intensity curve over the duration of the effect.
                  This is a legacy parameter, consider using intensity overlay layers instead.
