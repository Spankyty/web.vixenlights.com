### Overview

Creates an effect that outlines a display element with a border.

---

### String Setup

  * **Positioning** - Determines how the target elements are treated.  Either as individual strings or by their actual location in the display preview.
                      Locations is often referred to as whole house, but it can be any form of multiple props. 
                      Generally you want Strings when applying to one prop and locations if the target is multiple props.
  
  * **Orientation** - Controls the orientation of the display area (matrix).

### Configuration

* **Border Mode** - Selects the type of border.
 
  * [_Simple_](./border_simple) - This border mode provides a uniform border around the display element.
  * [_Advanced_](./border_advanced) - This border mode provides advanced control over the size and width of the border. 
  * [_Marquee_](./border_marquee) - This border mode provides moving bands of color moving around the display element.  
                                     This border mode also has special render levels that make visually interesting patterns on mega-trees.
