### Overview

Creates an effect that outlines a display element with a simple border.

---

### String Setup

  * **Positioning** - Determines how the target elements are treated.  Either as individual strings or by their actual location in the display preview.
                      Locations is often referred to as whole house, but it can be any form of multiple props. 
                      Generally you want Strings when applying to one prop and locations if the target is multiple props.
  
  * **Orientation** - Controls the orientation of the display area (matrix).

### Configuration

* **Border Mode** - Selects between _Simple_, _Advanced_, or _Marquee_ borders. 

---

### Border

* **Width** - Controls the thickness of the border.

---

### Color

* **Gradient Mode** - Configures how the **Color Gradient** is applied to the border
                      (_Over Time_, _Across Element_, _Vertically Across Element_, _Diagonal Bottom-Top Element_, _Diagonal Top-Bottom Element_).

* **Color Gradient** - Controls the colors of the border.

---

### Brightness

* **Intensity** - This is an overall brightness intensity curve over the duration of the effect.
                  This is a legacy parameter, consider using intensity overlay layers instead.
