## Overview

The Life effect is a random particle growth type effect. 
It is designed to imitate colonies of microbes as they replicate and grow. When set to a high cell start count, it resembles old fashioned TV snow. 
When set to a low Cell Start count, it can be made to somewhat resemble confetti.

## String Setup
 
  * **Orientation** - Controls the orientation of the display area (matrix).
---

## Configuration

* **Speed** - The speed at which the particles progress.

* **Cells to Start** - The number of pixels or &#8220;colonies&#8221; at the beginning of the effect.

* **Type** - This applies different variations to the growth pattern.

---

## Color

* **Gradients** -  One or more colors/gradients used randomly for each particle.

 ---

## Brightness

* **Intensity** - This is an overall brightness intensity curve over the duration of the effect.Â 
                  This is a legacy parameter, consider using intensity overlay layers instead.
