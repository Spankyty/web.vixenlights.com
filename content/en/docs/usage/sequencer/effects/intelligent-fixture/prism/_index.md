### Overview

Prism effect selects a prism to be placed in the light beam.
Depending on the capabilities of the fixture it also allows for controlling the rotation speed of the prism.
There is no support for the Prism effect in the preview at this time, although the preview legend can be used to verify the function is active.

### Configuration

* **Function** - The function on the intelligent fixture that controls the prism. If the fixture supports more than one prism this is where you pick the desired prism.

* **Setting** - Selects the position (angle) of the prism or an option to rotate the prism.

* **Rotation Speed** - Selects the rotation speed of the prism.

### Requirements 

* For an intelligent fixture to support the Prism effect it must have a Prism Index Function with the _Prism_ tag.
