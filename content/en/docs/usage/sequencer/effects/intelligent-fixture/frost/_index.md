### Overview

Frost effect controls a lens or filter that softens the edges of the light beam.
It can help with blending light/gobos/animation-wheels into a scene by hiding sharp edges.
There is no support for the Frost effect in the preview at this time, although the preview legend can be used to verify the function is active.

### Configuration

* **Function** - The function on the intelligent fixture that controls the frost filter.  If the fixture supports more than one frost lens this is where you pick the function.

* **Frost Percentage** - Configures the amount of softening of the light beam.

### Requirements 

* For an intelligent fixture to support the Frost effect it must have a Range Function with the _Frost_ tag.
