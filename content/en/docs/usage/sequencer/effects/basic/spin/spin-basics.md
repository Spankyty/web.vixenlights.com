The **Spin** is a lot like the [Chase]({{< ref "chase-basics">}}) effect. It can be thought of as repeating chases back to back. If you have learned the [Chase]({{< ref "chase-basics">}}) effect, you already have many of the concepts to use the **Spin** effect.

### Behavior (3.6u1+)

There are two types of behaviors. Across Elements/Groups is the default behavior and is equivalent to how the effect acted prior to 3.6u1.

Each Element/Group is a new behavior that changes how the effect looks at the elements and targets them. Previously you could use the levels and spin across a group of Arches or similar props, but if you wanted to apply the same spin to each Arch in the group, you would need to put a Spin on each Arch specifically. Now you can choose the Each Element/Group behavior and the proper level to get an identical Spin on each arch. This also allows the possibility to Spin up/down a Pixel tree instead of just around it. Many combinations are possible using variations of the Behavior and Level options.
