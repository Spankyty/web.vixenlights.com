The Pulse effect is one step above a Set Level. In fact this effect can do everything the Set Level can plus more. The main differences here are the ability to use a color gradient over a single color and the ability to shape the brightness as a curve value to vary over the length of the effect. See the sections on [Curves]({{< ref "">}}) and Color Gradients for more details on how they work.

With the ability to control the brightness over the duration of the effect, the Pulse enables things like a fade on or fade off by adjusting the curve from a ramp up or ramp down. But the curve can take any shape and thus you can form your pulse to do about anything.

The pulse is also highly useful as a modifying effect when using layers. It can be used to fade other effects on or off, or control their brightness. See the sections on [Layers]({{< ref "">}}) for more details.
