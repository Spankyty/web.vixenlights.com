### Setting up Your Show

There are two items that need to be setup and configured to run a show (a set of items including sequences). First, you need to setup a show in the [Show Editor][1]. This is where you tell the system what sequences, and various actions will be performed during the event.

### Running Your Show

After you have setup your show, you need to tell the Vixen system when you would like your show to run. Select **Scheduler** -> **Schedules** from the Vixen main menu. For more information look at the [Show Scheduler][2] section of the documentation.

### Video Tutorial

Check out the video demonstrating how to setup a show and schedule it to run.
