### Description

The net can be used to quickly cover an area with lights. Areas such as s tree-trunk or a bush can be covered without having to draw every strand of lights. It also makes a fairly accurate representation of icicle light strings.

### Settings

### Position

See Position in [Common Settings][1]

### Light Size

See Light Size in [Common Settings][1]

### Light Spacing

The light spacing is the number of pixels between each light in the net. You can just play with this number to get the look you like.

### Linked Elements

See [Linked Elements][2]
