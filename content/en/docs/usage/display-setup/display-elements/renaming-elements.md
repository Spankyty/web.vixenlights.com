### Introduction

There are multiple ways to rename elements. The simplest form is a single item rename. There are also features that enable multiple items to be renamed at the same time. One of them will be discussed here. The other one has it's own section under [Find/Replace]({{< ref renaming-elements-find-replace.md>}}).

### Simple Renaming

To rename a single element, you can select the element and then right click and select rename. You will be prompted with a dialog to enter the new name. Clicking the ok button will apply the change. If the new name for the element matches an existing name, it may append a unique qualifier because all element names must be unique.

### Multiple ElementÂ Rename

When you select multiple items to rename, a dialog box will appear to allow you to shape the renaming by forming templates. These templates are the same as the one used in the Add Multiple helpers that generate elements based on sequential naming patterns.
