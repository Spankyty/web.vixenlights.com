There are a few libraries that you need to have installed in order to get the application to build. Depending on how much you develop in other projects you may have these already installed.

Windows 10 or higher.

Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8

Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 x86 Redistributable

Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 x64 Redistributable

The current build target is .NET 4.8 and Visual C++ 2019, but we are actively migrating to .NET 6 and will be using Visual C++ 2022.
