Color gradients are a way of representing color over time in Vixen. Instead of having a single color, you can create colors with transitions in them that shift from one color to another. Multiple colors can be included in a gradient and you can shaoe via the editoer the points which the colors transition from one to another. Many of the effects are then able to take advantage of this and provide features that change the color over time.
