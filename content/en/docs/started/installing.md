### Overview

**All Windows 7/8 support ceased in 2020. Windows 8.1 will have limited support.**

Windows 10 or 11 is the recommended OS for the best results.

Mobile type processors often found in laptops have often been found to perform poorly with Vixen 3 when they are in power saving mode. You should make sure you have the power saving in performance mode or disabled for optimal results.

Setting your computer's power and performance settings to Maximum Performance is highly recommended.  If using a laptop, plugging it into a power source can improve performance as well.  (as opposed to running on batteries.) Additionally, if you intend to use the built in scheduler in V3, you may need to have a lot of RAM installed.  The exact amount varies based on the total number of effects and their complexity for the entire scheduled show.  16 GB or more may be necessary for mid sized shows.  The internal scheduler is not suitable for high channel count shows

### Which Version Do I Install?

Vixen is available as either a 32 bit or a 64 bit application.

* If you're running a 64 bit version of windows 8.1 or greater you should download and install the x64 package.
* If you're running a 32 bit version of windows, download and install the x32 package. The 32 bit version will likely be phased out in 2023.

The benefit of the 64 bit version is that it is able to make use of more system memory.  32 bit applications are limited to less than 3GB of memory.  If you are using a PC with more than 3GB of RAM, the 64 bit version will allow you use more of your available system memory to make the lights go blinky flashy.  This results in a faster, smother sequencing experience with less lag time. The 32 bit version will in fact work on an x64 version of windows, but if you've got 64 bit windows, why not use it.
